## Introduction

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a collection of open source protocols used to access centralized remote hierarchical directory services on a network. A directory service is a shared information infrastructure that allows you to access, manage, or modify resources on a network such as users, groups, devices, and other objects. The most common use of LDAP is to use it as a centralized user account management system to authenticate users on the network and to store all information concerning these accounts. LDAP is based on a client/server protocol where directory data is stored on the LDAP server and is typically used to contain the stored information of users. This centralized storage of user accounts on a single server greatly simplifies system administration. More specifically, OpenLDAP is an open source implementation of LDAP that runs on Linux/UNIX systems.
